This is the SQL you manually need to copy into the migrationfile if none exists,
to make sure the bookings won't overlap. On the database level. 

According to chatgpt.

protected override void Up(MigrationBuilder migrationBuilder)
{
    // Ensure btree_gist is available
    migrationBuilder.Sql("CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS btree_gist;");

    // Add generated column for date range
    migrationBuilder.Sql(@"
        ALTER TABLE ""Bookings""
        ADD COLUMN ""BookingPeriod"" tsrange
        GENERATED ALWAYS AS (tsrange(""StartDate"", ""EndDate"")) STORED;
    ");

    // Add EXCLUDE constraint to prevent overlapping bookings per Room
    migrationBuilder.Sql(@"
        ALTER TABLE ""Bookings""
        ADD CONSTRAINT booking_no_overlap
        EXCLUDE USING gist (""RoomId"" WITH =, ""BookingPeriod"" WITH &&);
    ");
}

protected override void Down(MigrationBuilder migrationBuilder)
{
    migrationBuilder.Sql(@"
        ALTER TABLE ""Bookings""
        DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS booking_no_overlap;
    ");

    migrationBuilder.Sql(@"
        ALTER TABLE ""Bookings""
        DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS ""BookingPeriod"";
    ");
}
